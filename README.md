## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze the Posey database tables to extract meaningful insights that can assist our company in understanding the market landscape. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various tables and presented our findings through visualizations and a detailed PowerPoint presentation.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Data Analysis** - Explore the Posey database tables and extract insights.
2. **Visualization** - Create visual representations of the data findings using dashboards and graphs.
3. **Presentation** - Design a PowerPoint presentation to summarize the key insights.

## Data Sources
The data for this analysis was derived from the following CSV files:
- **region.csv** - Contains information about different regions and their associated sales representatives.
- **sales_reps.csv** - Provides data on sales representatives, including their regions and assigned accounts.
- **web_events.csv** - Details web events related to customer interactions.
- **accounts.csv** - Contains information about customer accounts, including account names and associated sales reps.
- **orders.csv** - Lists customer orders with details such as order quantities and product types.
